Step, step
Step, step
Will I make it home? (Step)
Will I make it home? (Step)
Only God knows (Step)
Only God knows (Step)
Inside of the club, on a wall,
she was right there beside me
Couldn't tell there was danger
around me, damn, she blinded me
"Please watch your step,"
I heard from a concerned gentlemen
He was 'bout my age with a face
that displayed he was genuine
"Be safe," he said,
"Heard niggas who was loud in the hallway
By the bathroom door,
they was plottin' on you and your compadres"
So I sobered up quick
with a heightened sense of fear in me
What the fuck you doin' in the 'Ville
with no security?
Yeah, they'll say they love you,
but trust, that don't mean anything
Somebody gon' hate you, for what?
It could be anything
The way that you walk, you talk,
the way that you rap, you know
The way that you put on the 'Ville
but you barely come back no more
My radar is up,
I notice this dude with his hat real low
The vibe is negative,
I'm telling shawty, "We got to go"
And at the same moment,
I swear that the lights came on
The DJ was yellin' some shit
on the microphone, he said
Yeah, you ain't got to go home
(Oh, you ain't got to go back home)
But you gotta get the-but you gotta get
the fuck out of here
Fuck out of here, fuck out of here,
fuck out of here
(But you can't stay, can't stay)
When the lights come on
(Yeah, when those lights start turning on)
Everybody, get the-everybody,
get the fuck out of here
Fuck out of here, fuck out of here,
fuck out of here
(You can't stay, can't stay, can't stay)
Oh, will we survive the let out?
Will we survive the let out?
Will we survive the let out?
Will we survive the let out?
Oh, will we survive the let out?
Will we survive the let out?
Will we survive the let out?
Will we survive the-
She got the type of thang
you can't even find no more
They play the type of games
I don't be around no more
I see some niggas
that tyin' bandanas on they face
Hop in the trunk,
that's where the hammers always lay
I'm tryna find a way
to get to the parking spot
Feel like a mile away,
I got to get off the block
Shawty done stopped and put her hands
around my waist
And told me, "I want you" (Damn)
Step (Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,
not right now, right now, no)
Yes, it happened to me, my nigga
(Keep walking, keep walking, keep walking,
let's go this way, right here)
And please believe me
when I tell you it can happen to you
(Niggas on some weird shit)
Proceed with caution,
thinkin' they stalkin' your moves
Pistols be sparkin',
leaving your thoughts on your shoes
Outside of the club paranoid,
with keys in my hand
Heard the shots ring out,
full survival instincts, we ran
Will I make it home? (Will I make it home?)
Will I make it home? (Will I make it home?)
Only God, only God, only God knows
Will I make it home? (Will I make it home?)
Will I make it home?
Only God knows,
only God knows if I'ma ever
get back to you
Oh, will we survive the let out?
Will we survive the let out?
Will we survive the let out?
Will we survive the let out?
Oh, will we survive the let out?
Will we survive the let out?
Will we survive the let out?
Will we survive the let out?
In a hood near you (In a hood near you)
There's a late-night gathering of souls
in the parking lot shortly
after the club close 'cause
niggas don't wanna go home
But it won't be long
'fore somebody start wildin',
shots start firin',
and good times turn violent
At the let out
Oh, will we survive the let out?
Will we survive the let out?
Will we survive the let out?
Will we survive the let out?
Oh, will we survive the let out?
Will we survive the let out?
Will we survive the let out?
Will we survive the let out?
