There's something really special in the let go
When I let go
At times it's hard to do it but I let go

Ima sing a song to my friends
Everyday has a weekend
It's going down - let me live

Tell me where do you go
When you feel like you know
But you don't really know

Sometimes i feel like my hands are tied behind my back and
I'm fallin to the bottom of the ocean

How'd I know how to say these lines
How'd I know how to say these lines

Did I tell you back then 'bout the songs that I hadn't wrote

If you tell me how it flow
Then I'll tell you how the lyric go

There's something really special in the let go

There's Somethin that reminds You
What you ready know

We Only sing the songs from our radio
We only ever say all our favorite parts

The funny thing is - we don't have a radio

And the melodies we only ever made em up

I don't mind getting older
Cuz it's you and I
That's life and I can't change
Why would I even try
If I Could
If I could

Put a melody on my melody
You're my harmony
It's my everything

And we learn the songs from the radio
Just to sing 'em to eachother when we want

How'd I know how to say these lines
Did I tell you back then bout the songs that I hadn't wrote

If you tell me how it flow
Then I'll tell you how the lyric go

Put a melody on my melody
Be my harmony
Be my everything

If give it all away
Just because
I'd give it all away for you

There's something really special in the let go

There's Somethin that reminds you
What you ready know

We only sing the songs from our radio
We only ever say all our favorite parts

The funny thing is - we don't have a radio

And the melodies we only ever made em up

There's something really special in the let go

There's somethin' that reminds you
What you ready know

We only sing the songs from our radio
We only ever say all our favorite parts

The funny thing is - we don't have a radio

And the melodies we only ever made em up
